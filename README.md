# zero_sum_game_solver
This repository holds the code to solve zero sum games using the Simplex Method.

During the course "Economia Matem√°tica" at UFRGS focused on linear and non-linear programming i learned the simplex method, developed by Dantzig. This method is used for solving linear programming problems, and one of its aplication is to solve for zero sum games. So i decided apply this technique to python.

In the code you will find a implementation of the simplex method at "simplex_method.py". And another module to better handle game matrices at "game_to_simplex.py". I tested the code on the "main.ipynb".
