This repository holds the code to solve zero-sum games using the Simplex Method.

During the course, "Economia Matem√°tica" at UFRGS focused on linear and non-linear programming I learned the simplex method, developed by Dantzig. This method is used for solving linear programming problems, and one of its applications is to solve zero-sum games. So I decided to apply this technique to python.

In the code, you will find an implementation of the simplex method at "simplex_method.py". And another module to better handle game matrices at "game_to_simplex.py". I tested the code on the "main.ipynb".
